# LCP (Laboratory Context Protocol)

LCP is a universal communication protocol designed to standardize interactions between laboratory instruments and data processing systems in experimental automation.

## Overview

In traditional lab environments, researchers often manually operate instruments and rely on standalone control software for data acquisition and processing. This approach is inefficient and prone to data transfer errors and repetitive experiments. LCP defines a universal communication protocol that enables laboratory instruments to interact seamlessly with data analysis systems, multi-objective optimization (MO) algorithms, databases, and remote computing environments.

## Key Features

- **Protocol Adaptation**: Standardized integration of various laboratory devices using different communication protocols (MQTT, WebSocket, REST API)
- **Data Standardization**: Converts device-specific data formats into a unified LCP format
- **Device Control**: Provides a unified interface for controlling different types of laboratory instruments
- **Real-time Data Streaming**: Supports real-time data transmission from devices to processing systems
- **Extensibility**: Designed as an open standard, allowing developers to expand support for new instruments and protocols

## Supported Protocols

LCP currently supports the following communication protocols:

- **MQTT**: For lightweight, publish-subscribe based messaging (e.g., IoT sensors, Bambu, OT2)
- **WebSocket**: For real-time, bidirectional communication (e.g., video streams, real-time monitoring)
- **REST API**: For standard HTTP-based device communication (e.g., HPLC, LC-MS)
- **gRPC**: (Planned) For high-performance, binary communication

## Architecture

LCP follows a modular architecture with the following components:

- **Protocol Adapters**: Convert between device-specific protocols and LCP standard format
- **Data Models**: Define standardized data structures for device information and measurements
- **API Layer**: Provides REST endpoints for client applications to interact with devices
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secures device access and control
- **Error Handling**: Standardizes error reporting across different protocols
