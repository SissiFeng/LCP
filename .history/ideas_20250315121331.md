# LCP (Laboratory Context Protocol)

LCP (Laboratory Context Protocol) is a technical protocol our team is developing to address the **isolation between laboratory instruments and data processing systems** in experimental automation.  

In traditional lab environments, researchers often manually operate instruments and rely on **standalone control software** for data acquisition and processing. This approach is not only inefficient but also prone to **data transfer errors** and **repetitive experiments**. The goal of LCP is to **define a universal communication protocol** that enables laboratory instruments to interact seamlessly with data analysis systems, multi-objective optimization (MO) algorithms, databases, and remote computing environments, thereby enhancing experimental automation and data management efficiency.  

## **Key Features of LCP:**  
- **Instrument Connectivity** – Standardized integration of various laboratory devices (e.g., sensors, robots, analytical instruments).  
- **Data Stream Management** – Supports real-time data transmission in a standardized format to databases or processing pipelines.  
- **Multi-Objective Optimization Integration** – Seamlessly connects with MO algorithms to enable intelligent parameter adjustments.  
- **Extensibility** – Designed as an **open standard**, allowing developers to expand support for new instruments, optimization methods, and analytical tools.  

LCP is currently being integrated with the **Canvas system** (built on React Flow), aiming to create an **end-to-end experimental automation solution** that allows researchers to **design experiments like writing code** while optimizing workflows using intelligent algorithms.  

Although LCP originated from our efforts in **experimental automation**, it is designed to be **a general-purpose protocol**, applicable to **various smart laboratories and automated research platforms**. Developers can extend LCP to support new experimental environments and applications based on their research needs.

新模式（JSON-RPC/stdin）：

状态隔离更好：每个 LCP Server 运行独立的进程，与设备的生命周期绑定，不会因网络波动影响 Canvas 逻辑。
更适合多工作流管理：标准化的 JSON-RPC 格式支持更细粒度的请求标识，可结合 workflow_id 进行追踪。
兼容性高：能够逐步迁移，Canvas 现有 HTTP/MQTT 结构仍然能继续工作。
降低外部 API 依赖：减少 HTTP 开销，直接与 LCP 进程通信，适用于本地仪器或远程集群。
